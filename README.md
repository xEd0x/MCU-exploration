 A GRAPHical exploration of the Marvel Cinematic Universe

## The Project
The goal was to represent the Marvel Cinematic Universe with a graph, showing the links between the superheroes and the movies in which they appearead. Instead of making a big and probably chaotic graph, it was decided to divide the dataset in 3 sets, matching the "phases" created by Marvel itself. Every fase has its own graph representing the superheroes (with a circular image) and the movies (with a rectangular image).

## Features
Three different graphs, one for each phase, showing the connection with every superhero and every movie
When hovering the cursor on an image, it becomes a little bigger, the links to other nodes are highlighted and a brief description appears on the left
Possibility to drag the nodes smoothly
