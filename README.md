 A GRAPHical exploration of the Marvel Cinematic Universe

## The Project
The goal was to represent the Marvel Cinematic Universe with a graph, showing the links between the superheroes and the movies in which they appearead. Instead of making a big and probably chaotic graph, it was decided to divide the dataset in three sets, matching the "phases" created by Marvel itself.

## Features
* Three different graphs, one for each phase, showing the connection with every superhero and every movie
 * Every superhero is represented with a circular picture of his face
 * Every movie is represented with a rectangular image of the movie poster
* When hovering the cursor on an image, it becomes a little bigger, the links to other nodes are highlighted and a brief description appears on the left
* Possibility to drag the nodes smoothly
